                    <ul>
                        <li>Cut the chicken breasts in half horizontally (butterfly) or into thin fillets.

                        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil or butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
                        <li>Cook the chicken for 4-5 minutes per side, or until golden and cooked through. Remove and set aside.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Saute Onion and Garlic:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the same pan, add a little more oil or butter if needed. Saut√© the chopped onion for 2-3 minutes,
