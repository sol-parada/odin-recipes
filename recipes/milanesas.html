        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Milanesa are a traditional Argentine dish made of thin slices of meat (usually beef or chicken)
            breaded and fried until golden and crispy. Similar to a schnitzel, they are a 
            staple in Argentine households and often served with mashed potatoes, fries, or salad.</p>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the egg mix</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs.</li>
                        <li>Add the minced garlic, chopped parsley (if using), salt, and pepper.</li>
                        <li>Mix well.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Prepare the breadcrumb mixture:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In another shallow dish, mix the breadcrumbs with the grated PArmesan (if using)</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Bread the beef:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dip each beef cutlet into the egg mixture, coating both sides.</li>
                        <li>Then coat it with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently so the crumbs stick well.</li>
                        <li>Place the breaded cutlets on a plate or tray.</li>      
                    </ul>
                <li>Let it rest (optional but recommended)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Let the breaded cutlets rest in the fridge for 15-30 minutes. This helps 
                            the coating stick better during frying.
                        </li>

                        <li>Fry the milanesas one or two at time (don't overcrowd the pan) until 
                            golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side.
                        </li>
