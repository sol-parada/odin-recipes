# Odin Recipes

This project is a simple recipe website developed entirely with HTML as part of The Odin Project practice. Its main goal is to demonstrate how to structure a basic web page and link different internal pages.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main page, listing links to each available recipe.
- Each recipe is in its own HTML file and can be accessed through a link on the main page.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sol-parada/odin-recipes.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser.
3. Click the links to view each recipe.

## Features

- 100% HTML, no CSS or JavaScript.
- Simple navigation between the main page and individual recipes.
